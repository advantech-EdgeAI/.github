## Bridging the Gap with Advantech Solution Pilot

Advantech is a global leader in IPC solutions, spanning from servers to edge devices. As we step into the exciting world of AI, we are focused on making edge computing smarter and bridging the gap between humans and machines. At the heart of this mission is the Advantech Solution Pilot.

Advantech Solution Pilot is a suite of production-ready software services designed to supercharge our MIC-AI series. It takes NVIDIA's powerful AI software and toolkits as a foundation and enhances them with Advantech’s unique add-on features to make them easier to set up and deploy.

### Advantech Solution Pilot Portfolio 🛩️

The ecosystem consists of three specialized projects designed to empower edge intelligence:

- **Edge Agent**: An interactive sandbox built on NVIDIA Agent Studio that simplifies the integration of multi-modal LLMs, Text-To-Speech (TTS), and live sensors via a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface.

- **AI NVR**: A video analytics application built using NVIDIA Metropolis Microservices for Jetson, featuring object detection, face recognition, and specialized tools like Video Storage Toolkit (VST).

- **VSS**: A reference architecture utilizing NVIDIA Cosmos Reason 1.1 VLM to enable contextualized video summarization, natural language Q&A, and real-time alerting.

#### Understanding the AMR Ecosystem

To successfully deploy an intelligent robot, it is important to understand the relationship between our three AMR-focused services:

- **AMR DevKit**: The "Body" of our robotics suite; it provides a stable hardware-integration foundation with pre-configured drivers for GMSL cameras and LiDAR, along with accurate 3D URDF models.

- **AMR Perceptor**: The "Brain" extension for the DevKit; it adds high-level intelligence using NVIDIA TensorRT-accelerated models (like YOLOv8) and Llama.cpp to provide 3D object detection and natural language reasoning.

- **AMR ReMEmbR**: The "Memory" layer; built on the NVIDIA ReMEmbR workflow, it allows robots to build semantic maps and store environmental data in a vector database for long-term spatial memory.

### Powered by MIC-AI 📦

All services are optimized for the MIC-AI series, our compact, industrial-grade edge AI systems accelerated by NVIDIA Jetson. Whether you are working on rugged heavy machinery or smart city video analytics, Advantech Solution Pilot and MIC-AI provide the performance and flexibility needed for the modern edge.
